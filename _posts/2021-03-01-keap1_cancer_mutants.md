<b>Abstract:</b>
We have performed 280 microseconds of unbiased molecular dynamics (MD) simulations to investigate the effects of 12 different cancer mutations on Keap1, one of the frequently mutated genes in lung cancer. The aim is to provide structural insight into the effects of these mutants, including a new class of ANCHOR (additionally NRF2-complexed hypomorph) mutant variants. Our findings demonstrate the efficacy of MD simulations in predicting the effects of mutant variants on the Keap1 protein structure, and points to stability as a possible target of cancer in Keap1. Interestingly, structural analysis of the R470C ANCHOR mutant, the most frequently mutated residue in Keap1, revealed no significant change in structural stability or binding site dynamics, possibly indicating interaction with another domain in Keap1, or an \textit{in vivo} covalent modification, as this mutant's mode of action.
